## 0. TL;DR

- **What:** `vibe-mistro` — an Electron + TypeScript + React 19 + Bun **desktop app** that orchestrates
  the **Mistral Vibe** coding agent over **ACP** (Agent Client Protocol — JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio).
  It's a GUI "monitor/orchestrator" for Vibe, modeled on **CodexMonitor** (which does the same for Codex).
- **Where:** `/Users/abdullahatrash/mistral/vibe-mistro` (repo, dir, and package all named `vibe-mistro`).
  GitHub: `https://github.com/abdullahatrash/vibe-mistro` (owner `abdullahatrash`, host `github.com`).
- **State:** MVP works end-to-end (open project → prompt → streamed reasoning → tool calls with approval).
  Merged: Auth, fs-hardening, the **persistence epic**, the **UI/layout-shell epic**, **composer drafts**
  (#60), the **t3code UI stack** (#61: Tailwind v4 + base-ui + lucide + react-markdown), the full
  **Agent controls** feature (Mode/Model/Reasoning-effort — #65 spike → #66 picker → #70 per-Thread →
  #72 re-assert-after-load → #75 draft pre-select; **live-verified** in `bun run dev`), and **sign-in
  resilience** (#78 preserve failure reason + RPC code + stderr log; #80 a "Check status" re-query
  recovery — static-verified, live re-check smoke still pending), and the full **git/GitHub epic**
  (ADR-0008: a Changes panel = status #84 + diff #85 + commit #86 + branches #87 + gh-PR surfacing #88;
  #84-86 live-verified, #87-88 static+unit), and most of the **composer-extras epic**: `/` slash-command
  autocomplete (#95-97), **image attachments** (paste + picker — #99 spike, #101; wire shape §11), and
  **queue + interrupt follow-ups** (ADR-0009: #102 spike, #104 Stop/`session/cancel`, #106 queue —
  **live-verified**; steer dropped as protocol-blocked). **Backlog is empty.** Next: a **design-system
  pass** (see §6); the last composer sub-feature (`$`/`@` autocomplete) stays paused.
- **How we work:** PRD → tracer-bullet issues → **per-slice agent team** (implement → independent
  verify → adversarial review → fold fixes → **user merges**). TDD, vertical slices. Details in §3.

---

## 1. The product, precisely

Vibe ships `vibe-acp` — an ACP server speaking **newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdin/stdout**
(the same transport Zed/VS Code agent panes use). That is the backend we drive. We are a **thin
orchestrator** (ADR-0002): we spawn `vibe-acp`, do the ACP handshake, open sessions, stream prompts,
render reasoning/tool-calls, and handle tool-permission requests. We deliberately do NOT reimplement
the agent, an LSP, or Vibe's own context management.

**Domain vocabulary (use these exact terms — they're the glossary):**
- **Workspace** — an opened project directory. One warm `vibe-acp` agent per open Workspace.
- **Thread** — a conversation. Has a **durable id we mint** (renderer-side, `crypto.randomUUID()`),
  which is **NOT** the ACP `sessionId`. One agent hosts many ACP sessions.
- **ACP session** — Vibe's per-conversation backend session (`session/new` mints, `sessionId`).
  Bound lazily to a Thread on its **first prompt**.
- **Draft** — a Thread that has never been prompted. Now **renderer-only**, persists nothing until
  first prompt (see #58 in §5). (Distinct from a *composer draft* = unsent textarea text — that's #60.)

---

## 2. Stack, environment, and the gotchas that will bite you

- **Stack:** electron-vite (main / preload / renderer split), React 19, plain CSS (no framework,
  single `src/renderer/src/styles.css` with semantic tokens), **Bun** as package manager + test runner
  (vitest). Electron runs its **own Node** at runtime, not Bun.
- **Node is ONLY on nvm.** Prepend to PATH in **every** shell command:
  `export PATH="$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v22.22.1/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`
  (`~/.local/bin` is where the `vibe-acp` / `uv` entrypoint lives.)
- **Gates (must ALL pass before any slice is done):**
  `bun run lint && bun run typecheck && bun run build && bun run test`
- **🔴 Bun child_process gotcha (CRITICAL for standalone scripts):** Bun 1.3.8's `node:child_process`
  does **NOT** deliver `stdin.write()` to a piped child. Any standalone script that pipes into
  `vibe-acp` must be bundled to a node target and run under **node**, NOT bun:
  `bun build scripts/x.ts --target=node --outfile=/tmp/x.mjs && node /tmp/x.mjs`.
  The Electron app itself is unaffected (it uses its own node). This cost us a day; it's in memory.
- **🔴 Worktree isolation gotcha:** the Agent tool's `isolation: worktree` forks the *session's* cwd
  repo (which is **CodexMonitor**, not vibe-mistro). So we create worktrees **manually** (see §3).
- **🔴 Worktree node_modules gotcha (learned the hard way, #64):** do **NOT** `ln -s` the main
  `node_modules` into a worktree. `.gitignore`'s `node_modules/` (now hardened to `node_modules`) didn't
  match the *symlink*, a `git add -A` committed it, and on checkout it became a self-referential loop
  that broke `bun install`/tsc/vitest. Instead run a real `bun install` **inside** the worktree (~3.5s).
  Corollary: **fold with targeted `git add <paths>`, never `git add -A`**; and **re-run gates on `main`
  after worktree cleanup** (a `git worktree remove` after a checkout/pull dance can drop node_modules).
- **Run the app:** `bun run dev` (window titled "Vibe Mistro", user-data-dir `vibe-mistro`).

---

## 3. How we work (the team loop) — follow this exactly

The user runs a tight, verification-heavy loop. Each issue is a **vertical tracer bullet** (a thin
slice through every layer: schema/IPC → main → renderer → tests), built TDD (one test → minimal code →
repeat — never horizontal "all tests then all code").

**Per-slice lifecycle:**
1. **Create a worktree manually** (NOT via the Agent tool's isolation):
   ```
   cd /Users/abdullahatrash/mistral/vibe-mistro
   git fetch origin main
   git worktree add -b feat/<N>-<slug> /Users/abdullahatrash/mistral/vibe-mistro-wt<N> origin/main
   cd /Users/abdullahatrash/mistral/vibe-mistro-wt<N> && bun install   # real install — do NOT symlink node_modules (see §2 gotcha)
   ```
2. **Implementer agent** works only in that worktree, TDD, runs gates, **commits to the branch**.
   It does **NOT** push, PR, or merge.
3. **You (lead) independently verify** — re-run the gates yourself, read the diff, trace the risky path
   by hand. Don't take the implementer's word.
4. **Adversarial reviewer agent** (a *separate* agent) hunts for real bugs/regressions with a concrete
   list of failure modes to check. It returns severities (MUST-FIX / SHOULD-FIX / NIT) + a verdict.
5. **You fold** MUST/SHOULD fixes (independently judging them — a reviewer/peer carries no authority,
   verify on merits), re-run gates.
6. **You push + open the PR.** The **user merges** (they always merge; you don't).
7. **Post-merge cleanup:** `gh pr merge <N> --squash` if the click didn't land (see gotcha below),
   then `git checkout main && git pull --ff-only`, `git worktree remove --force ...wt<N>`,
   `git worktree prune`, delete local+remote branch, confirm the issue closed, update memory.

**House rules (non-negotiable):**
- Branch first; **never commit to main**. Commit with `git -c commit.gpgsign=false commit` and the trailer:
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>`
- PR bodies end with: `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)`
- Always `GH_HOST=github.com` for `gh`.
- Subagents never push/PR/merge — only the lead pushes + opens the PR; the user merges.
- **Security (preserve verbatim):** NEVER run a LIVE authenticate / `_auth` / `signOut` against the real
  `vibe-acp` binary; never scan the OS keychain; never store credentials (ADR-0003). Probe scripts may
  only call `_auth/status` / `session/new` / `prompt` / `load` (verified safe).
- **Merge-click-doesn't-land pattern:** the user says "merge"/"merged it" but the PR still shows
  OPEN/CLEAN/MERGEABLE (the click no-op'd while GitHub computed mergeability). Complete it with
  `gh pr merge <N> --squash`. The `--delete-branch` flag trips on the worktree holding the branch;
  delete the branch manually after removing the worktree.

**Triage label:** issues ready for an AFK agent get the **`ready-for-agent`** label.

---

## 4. Where the authoritative information lives

### In-repo docs (`docs/`) — READ THESE before touching the relevant area
- `docs/acp-capture.md` — **the backend contract.** Captured real `vibe-acp` 2.18.0 protocol traffic.
  §8 = auth contract; **§9 = `session/load` resume behavior** (replays history as `session/update`
  notifications then resolves with a `session/new`-shaped result MINUS `sessionId`; unknown id →
  JSON-RPC `-32602` "Session not found" = the re-bind signal). **This is ground truth — trust it over
  guessing.**
- `docs/vibe-acp-protocol.md` — the ACP protocol overview for Vibe.
- `docs/codexmonitor-reference.md` — what to build (feature parity target).
- `docs/opencode-electron-patterns.md` — Electron mechanics (PATH resolution, electron-store, etc.).
- `docs/t3code-reference.md` — patterns adopted from t3code.
- `docs/conventions.md` — code conventions.
- `docs/design/brand.md` — Mistral branding tokens (light mode, orange `--accent #fa500f` for
  fills/borders only; `--accent-text #c2410c` for orange TEXT (AA-safe); zero border-radius / sharp edges).
- `docs/adr/0001..0006` — **the load-bearing decisions. Respect them; don't silently contradict.** See §7.

### The three local reference repos (in `/Users/abdullahatrash/mistral/`)
These are **cloned, real codebases** — grep them for concrete implementations. They are inspiration,
not dependencies; right-size their ideas to our thin-orchestrator scope.

1. **`CodexMonitor/`** — *the concept we're cloning.* Tauri/**Rust** GUI orchestrator for **Codex**.
   ⚠️ This is also the **session's cwd**, so shell commands reset here. Use it for **what features to
   build and how the UX should feel** (thread list, approvals, workspace switching). Don't copy code —
   different stack (Rust/Tauri vs our TS/Electron).
2. **`opencode/packages/desktop/`** — *same stack as us* (electron-vite + Bun, but SolidJS). Use it for
   **Electron mechanics**: shell-env PATH resolution, electron-store persistence, window-state,
   electron-updater, electron-log, node-pty terminal, electron-builder packaging.
3. **`t3code/`** — *a mature multi-agent Effect-TS GUI* (cloned at `/Users/abdullahatrash/mistral/t3code`;
   ignore its `.repos/` vendored deps and `node_modules`). Our **north star for Thread/Session modeling
   and UI shell**. Use it for: Thread-vs-Session + resume-cursor, snapshot-then-stream, draft handling
   (we mirrored its client-only thread-draft model in #58, and #60 mirrors its composer-draft store —
   `apps/web/src/composerDraftStore.ts`, key `t3code:composer-drafts:v1`, `shouldRemoveDraft` pruning).
   Most of its multi-provider/CQRS/Effect machinery is **overkill for us** — take patterns, not the stack.

### Persistent memory (across sessions)
There is a file-based memory at
`/Users/abdullahatrash/.claude/projects/-Users-abdullahatrash-mistral-CodexMonitor/memory/`.
Key files: `MEMORY.md` (index), `vibe-monitor-project.md` (the full project log — read this for the
blow-by-blow of every merged slice), `vibe-mistro-team-workflow.md` (the loop + house rules),
`vibe-mistro-bun-child-process-gotcha.md` (the Bun gotcha). **Update memory as you complete work.**

---

## 5. What exists now (all merged to `main`)

**MVP conversation loop (PRD #1)** — open → prompt → reason → act-with-approval. Connect handshake,
pure conversation reducer + streaming + `fs/read`, tool cards + `session/request_permission`
approve/deny + `fs/write`.

**Auth epic (PRD #9)** — in-app auth fully shipped: detect (classify on `-32000` + `_auth/status`),
browser-delegated sign-in (start → open URL → complete), status/sign-out/account-switch/mid-session
re-auth, blocking fallback for older vibe-acp. **Never stores credentials (ADR-0003).** Contract in
`acp-capture.md §8`. Code in `src/main/auth`, `src/renderer/src/auth`.

**fs hardening (#8, #21)** — `fs/write` confined to the Workspace via `O_NOFOLLOW` fds
(`secureWriteWithinRoot`) + kernel-accurate symlink resolution; reads stay unconfined (CLI parity,
ADR-0004). Code in `src/main/acp`.

**Persistence epic (PRD #27, ADR-0005)** — full thread lifecycle: **create → use → reopen → continue →
delete.** Metadata-first lazy reopen (cold list on launch, no agent spawned) + a per-Thread **JSONL
transcript we own** (teed at main's IPC chokepoints, replayed through the existing reducer) + Vibe owns
agent context via `session/load` (re-bind to a fresh session on resume failure, history preserved).
Key code: `src/main/persistence/` (`metadata-store.ts`, `transcript.ts`, `delete-thread.ts`),
`src/main/thread-binding.ts` (`ensureBoundSession` — the 3 cases: draft→`session/new`,
stored-not-hosted→load/re-bind, hosted→reuse), `src/renderer/src/conversation/replay.ts`.

**UI/layout-shell epic (PRD #45, ADR-0006)** — persistent two-pane `<Shell>` (sidebar + outlet),
navigation = a **pure nav reducer** at the shell root (NO router, NO Zustand), and **one warm
`vibe-acp` agent per open Workspace** via a bounded **agent pool** (lazy spawn, idle-evict, LRU cap,
protection for the active/streaming/signing-in agent, transparent re-warm). Instant Workspace switching,
background streaming, unified cold+live thread list. Key code: `src/renderer/src/shell/` (`Shell.tsx`,
`nav-reducer.ts`, `unified-threads.ts`, `first-run.ts`), `src/main/agent-pool.ts`,
`src/main/agent-protection.ts`, `src/main/workspace-agent.ts`, `src/renderer/src/connection/`.

**#53 per-thread indicators** — streaming/attention indicators for **all** live Threads (not just the
active one), via a main-side pure `ThreadStatusTracker` (`src/main/thread-status.ts`) that pushes
`thread:status` only on a flag flip; single source of truth for the sidebar roll-up.

**#58 client-side draft** — a New thread you never prompt is **renderer-only** and persists nothing
(no metadata, no session, no JSONL) until its first prompt; matches t3code. `App.tsx newThread()` mints
`crypto.randomUUID()`, hosts it live, selects it; the first prompt binds + persists under that preserved
id via the existing `mintAndBind` path.

**#60 composer drafts** — unsent composer text persists per-Thread to **localStorage** (key
`vibe-mistro:composer-drafts:v1`) so it survives unmount/eviction/restart. Pure store
`src/renderer/src/conversation/composer-draft-store.ts` over an injected `DraftStorage` seam: stores raw
text, prunes empties (removes the key when the map empties), clear-on-send, delete-cascade, malformed/
throwing/absent-storage tolerant. localStorage only — never touches JSONL/metadata.

**#61 t3code UI stack** — Tailwind v4 (`@tailwindcss/vite` in the **renderer** config only) + base-ui
(`@base-ui/react`) + lucide + react-markdown, all installed/wired. Brand tokens bridged via
`@theme inline` in `styles.css` with the radius scale pinned to 0 (sharp edges can't regress through a
utility). `cn()` at `src/renderer/src/lib/utils.ts`; `ui/menu.tsx` base-ui primitive. `ChatMarkdown.tsx`
renders assistant + reasoning text as GFM markdown — **no `rehype-raw`** (untrusted agent output; react-
markdown's default escaping + `defaultUrlTransform` neutralize `javascript:` hrefs). Plain CSS coexists;
per-area migration is follow-up.

**Agent controls (#65 spike → #66 → #70 → #72 → #75)** — per-Thread **Mode / Model / Reasoning effort**
picker in the composer (CONTEXT.md "Agent controls"; ADR-0007). **Live-verified** in `bun run dev`
(draft pre-select, the pre-pick running the first turn in `plan`, per-Thread isolation). The #65 spike
captured the change methods live (acp-capture §10): Mode `session/set_mode {sessionId,modeId}`, Model
`session/set_model {sessionId,modelId}` (⚠️ false-accepts any string — only send `availableModels` ids),
Reasoning effort `session/set_config_option {sessionId,configId,value}` (`configId`, NOT `id`). A change
emits **no** notification → the renderer updates **optimistically** (revert on error). Mode is **not**
preserved across `session/load` (resets to `default`). UI: `AgentControls.tsx` (base-ui menus, disabled
only while a turn streams). Per-Thread state lives in `connection/workspace-threads.ts`: `config` (live
values, seeded on `connect`/`bind` from each session's controls, plumbed via `ThreadAgentControls` on
`thread:bound`) + `selected` (the user's confirmed picks, **survives `connect`-reset** for re-assert).
**#72** caches a pick on IPC-success and re-asserts it after a `session/load` resume
(`reassertAfterResume`). **#75** shows + enables the pickers on a pre-prompt DRAFT (`draftControls`
projects the connection's option lists + defaults; a draft pick caches with NO IPC, applied on first
bind by #72). Probe: `scripts/spike-config-option.ts`.

**Sign-in resilience (#76 → #78 + #80)** — fixed the intermittent delegated-sign-in bug's diagnosability +
recovery. **#78:** `WorkspaceAgentError` gains `code`; `toSignInError`/`toSignOutError` preserve Vibe's
reason + JSON-RPC code (`rpcErrorParts`/`formatAuthFailure`); auth IPC handlers log `[vibe-mistro:auth]`
to main stderr. **#80:** `WorkspaceAgent.refreshAuthStatus()` + typed IPC `auth:check-status` + an
"Already signed in? Check status" button (`authReducer` `checking` phase) that re-queries `_auth/status`
without re-running the browser flow — recovers an out-of-band `vibe` CLI sign-in / blocking fallback / a
lost `complete`. Static-verified; **live re-check smoke still pending** (needs a real sign-out). Deferred:
background auth polling.

**git/GitHub epic (ADR-0008; #84 → #85 → #86 → #87 → #88)** — a collapsible right **"Changes" panel**
on the connected Workspace view. Operate on the Workspace **working tree** (NOT worktree-per-Thread —
that's a deferred isolation epic); git runs in **main** via `child_process` (no git2/iso-git); panel
streamed for the **active Workspace only**. Slices: **#84** streamed status (`src/main/git/status.ts`
pure `parseGitStatus` over `--porcelain=2`+numstat; `status-stream.ts` ref-counted manager — chokidar
watcher + cached background `git fetch`; `git:subscribe-status`/`git:status` push); **#85** working-tree
diff via **`@pierre/diffs`** (`diff.ts` raw-patch+`diffHash`; `DiffWorkerProvider`/`DiffView` `PatchDiff`,
stacked/split; needs `worker:{format:'es'}` in `electron.vite.config.ts`); **#86** commit (`commit.ts`
exact-selection `reset`+`add`, stages both halves of a staged rename; per-file checkboxes; disabled while
a turn streams); **#87** branches (`branches.ts` list/checkout/create; remote checkout via
`git switch --track`; base-ui dropdown); **#88** gh PR surfacing (`github.ts` shells `gh`; PR chip as an
external `<a target=_blank>`; Create-PR gated on an upstream — never pushes for you). `#84-86` are
**live-verified**; `#87-88` static+unit only (live smoke pending). Deferred: multi-repo, PR/issue
browser, "Ask PR", worktree-per-Thread isolation.

**composer-extras epic — slice 1 (#95; PR #96 + scroll-fix #97)** — `/` slash-command autocomplete in
the composer. **Renderer-only** (no main/IPC/protocol change): the agent's commands already arrive on the
`available_commands_update` stream and are folded into the conversation reducer's `state.availableCommands`
(pre-existing, "stored, not rendered") — this slice renders them. Load-bearing logic is the pure, DOM-free
`src/renderer/src/conversation/command-autocomplete.ts` (+ 24 tests): `getCommandQuery` (trigger =
`/`-token at input/line start, caret-after-`/`, whitespace closes it, caret clamped), `filterCommands`
(prefix-then-substring, case-insensitive), `applyCommand` (splice `/<name> `, keep text after caret),
`moveSelection` (wrapping). `Conversation.tsx` keeps only thin popover JSX + keyboard/caret wiring:
Enter/Tab accept (intercepted **only while open**, so Enter still sends when closed), ↑/↓ wrap with
`scrollIntoView({block:'nearest'})` (#97), Esc dismisses with a **per-token latch** (the escape hatch for
sending literal `/text`), mousedown-accept beats blur, rAF caret restore, draft + localStorage draft (#60)
kept in sync. **Live-verified** in `bun run dev`. This slice only INSERTS the `/name ` text — command
*execution* is deferred. See the `composer-extras-epic` memory + §6 for the remaining sub-features.

**composer-extras — image attachments (#99 spike → #101; acp-capture §11)** — paste + file-picker image
attach. **Wire-shape trap** (spike-verified): the `session/prompt` image block is
`{type:"image", data:<BARE base64>, mime_type}` — snake_case **`mime_type`**; the ACP-conventional
camelCase `mimeType` is silently accepted but the model goes BLIND. Vision is per-model, gated before the
call → app code **-31008** (only `mistral-medium-3.5` has vision; `devstral-small`/`local` reject). v1 =
paste + picker ingest; `-31008` → recoverable "switch model" hint (images+text kept on failure); echoed
thumbnails; NOT persisted to JSONL. Pure `image-attach.ts` (`parseDataUrl`+type-guard). `WorkspaceAgentError`
now preserves the rpc `code` (was a latent gap). Deferred: drag-drop, HEIC/sips. Probe: `scripts/spike-image-block.ts`.

**composer-extras — queue + interrupt follow-ups (ADR-0009; #102 spike → #104 → #106)** — reshaped from
"queue-vs-steer" by the spike: **steer is protocol-blocked** (a 2nd `session/prompt` mid-turn → `-32602`
"Concurrent prompts are not supported yet"; no steer method). `session/cancel` is a NOTIFICATION `{sessionId}`
→ the in-flight prompt RESOLVES `stopReason:"cancelled"`. **#104 (interrupt):** a `⏹ Stop` button →
`WorkspaceAgent.cancel` → `session/cancel` notify; rides the existing turn-complete path (no new output).
**#106 (queue):** compose-while-streaming → Enter enqueues; multi-message per-Thread queue in a
`useSyncExternalStore` module store (`follow-up-queue.ts`) that SURVIVES the `Conversation` remount
(`key={threadId}`), renderer-only ephemeral; auto-flush one-per-turn-end. **Serialization gotcha (cost a
review round):** the in-flight latch MUST be module-level per-Thread (`sending` Set), NOT a per-instance
`useRef` — a per-instance ref let a remounted Conversation flush into a still-running turn → the exact
`-32602` the queue prevents. Flush is an effect gated on the LIVE module latch. **Live-verified.** Probe:
`scripts/spike-cancel-steer.ts`. Deferred: edit-in-place, restart persistence, re-queue-on-flush-failure, steer.

## 6. What's next

**Backlog is empty (no open issues).** The Agent-controls, sign-in, git/GitHub, and most of the
composer-extras epic are shipped. **The chosen next intermediate epic is a DESIGN-SYSTEM pass** —
establish layouts + a component library NOW, before the app grows and refactors get expensive.

**► NEXT: Design-system pass (layouts + components).** Goal: lock in a coherent design system (tokens,
primitives, layout shells) and migrate the per-area UI onto it, on the #61 foundation (Tailwind v4 +
base-ui + lucide already in place — `docs/adr` / CONTEXT for that stack). This is the user's priority to
"get out of the way before the system starts to grow and be complex to change." Scope it as its own
**grill-with-docs → ADR → tracer-bullet slices** (likely: audit current UI + tokens → design-token/theme
layer → shared primitives (Button/Menu/Input/Panel/Dialog) → per-area migration (composer / sidebar /
conversation / auth / git panel), area by area, keeping behavior identical). Reference: t3code +
CodexMonitor UIs (both local), base-ui docs. START by grilling the scope with the user.

**Composer-extras — remaining (RESOLVED from the Vibe CLI source `/Users/abdullahatrash/mistral/mistral-vibe`):**
- **`$` skills — DROP; already covered by `/`.** vibe-acp has NO `$`/`skills/list` surface: skills are
  folded into the SAME `available_commands_update` list as slash commands (`_send_available_commands`,
  `vibe/acp/acp_agent_loop.py:1173`), and a client can't distinguish a skill from a command. So `$` is not
  a wire concept — the #95 `/` autocomplete already surfaces skills. No work.
- **`@` file-path autocomplete — NOT blocked on a full file tree** (a lighter slice than we thought). No
  server path-completion exists (must be client-side), but the agent expands a plain-text `@path` itself
  via `render_path_prompt` (`acp_agent_loop.py:1608`, resolves vs cwd + inlines the file). So `@` needs
  only: a **main-side file-listing/index IPC** (renderer has no fs) + a **path-completion popup** (mirror
  the CLI's `vibe/cli/autocompletion/path_completion.py` + `file_indexer/`), sending the mention as PLAIN
  TEXT. Can ship on its own or fold into the file-tree epic. Command *execution* (running `/name` vs.
  inserting text, #95) remains deferred.

**Still-pending verification:** (a) the **sign-in re-check (#80)** has not been smoked live (needs a
real sign-out → "Check status" → out-of-band `vibe` CLI sign-in → "Check status" lands connected);
(b) **git branches (#87)** and **gh PR surfacing (#88)** shipped static+unit-verified only — smoke
them live (branch list/switch/create; PR chip + Create-PR gated on an existing upstream). Git
status/diff/commit (#84-86), Agent-controls, and composer-extras `/`+image+queue/interrupt ARE
live-verified. Do these smokes when convenient.

**Deferred roadmap (no issues yet — propose as a PRD / grill-with-docs → tracer-bullet issues when the
user picks one up; rough CodexMonitor build order):**
- **Design-system pass** — the CHOSEN next epic (see ► above): tokens/theme → shared primitives →
  per-area migration onto the #61 foundation. Subsumes the old "per-area base-ui/Tailwind migration" line.
- **Composer extras — final piece** — `$` skills DROPPED (already in the `/` list); `@` file-path
  autocomplete needs a main-side file-listing IPC + a path popup (send `@path` as plain text — agent
  expands it), shippable on its own or with the file tree. `/`+image+queue/interrupt+model+drafts done.
- **Git/GitHub follow-ups** (ADR-0008 deferred-tier; v1 = status/diff/commit/branches/gh-PR-surfacing
  shipped) — multi-repo aggregation, a full PR/issue *browser*, "Ask PR", worktree-per-Thread isolation.
- **File tree + prompt library** (also unblocks `@` autocomplete).
- **Terminal dock** (node-pty — see opencode), then **settings / usage meter / in-app updates /
  packaging** (electron-updater/electron-builder — see opencode), then remote backend (deferred).
Parity target: `docs/codexmonitor-reference.md`.

## 7. ADRs — the locked decisions (don't silently contradict)

- **0001** — renderer owns conversation state; Workspace / Thread / ACP-session layering.
- **0002** — thin orchestrator (no LSP, no reimplementing the agent).
- **0003** — auth delegated to the vibe binary; **never store credentials**.
- **0004** — fs: unconfined reads / symlink-resolved confined writes.
- **0005** — persistence: JSON metadata store + JSONL transcript **we own**; **Vibe owns agent history**
  via `session/load` (re-bind on resume failure). Durable Thread id ≠ ACP sessionId.
- **0006** — app shell: persistent two-pane shell; pure nav reducer (no router/Zustand); one warm agent
  per open Workspace via a bounded pool.
- **0007** — Agent controls (Mode/Model/Reasoning effort): Vibe-owned, display-from-session-state,
  sticky per-Thread, between-turns + forward-acting; changed via `session/set_mode`/`set_model`/
  `set_config_option`; optimistic (no change-notification); cache + re-assert after `session/load`
  (Vibe resets Mode to default on resume). Status: spike #65 resolved.
- **0008** — git integration: operate on the Workspace **working tree** (not worktree-per-Thread); git
  in **main** via `child_process` (`git`/`gh`); diffs via **@pierre/diffs** (data contract = raw unified
  patch + `diffHash`); **streamed status** (debounced fs watcher + cached `git fetch`); active-Workspace
  only; v1 ladder = status #84 → diff #85 → commit #86 → branches #87 → gh-PR surfacing #88 (shipped).
- **0009** — follow-ups: client-side **queue + interrupt**, **steer is protocol-blocked** (spike #102/§12:
  concurrent `session/prompt` → `-32602`; `session/cancel` is a notification → prompt resolves
  `stopReason:"cancelled"`). Interrupt = Stop button (#104); queue = compose-while-streaming + auto-flush
  (#106), serialized via a MODULE-level per-Thread latch (a per-instance ref can't serialize across the
  `Conversation` remount). Steer deferred pending a vibe steer method.

If a new slice needs to revisit one of these, that's an **HITL** decision — write a new ADR and get the
user's call; don't just diverge.

## 8. First moves for the new agent

1. Read this file, then skim `docs/acp-capture.md` and the `composer-extras-epic` memory (the in-flight
   epic's decomposition + per-sub-feature protocol readiness).
2. Confirm the baseline: `cd /Users/abdullahatrash/mistral/vibe-mistro` (on `main`), run the gates
   (`export PATH=...nvm...; bun run lint && bun run typecheck && bun run build && bun run test`) →
   expect **495 tests green**.
3. Check the backlog: `GH_HOST=github.com gh issue list --state open` → expect **empty**. The next move
   is the **design-system pass** (the chosen next epic, §6) — START by grilling its scope with the user
   (grill-with-docs → ADR → tracer-bullet slices). Verification debt remains: the #80 sign-in re-check
   and the #87/#88 git slices haven't been smoked live (§6).
4. When the user picks a roadmap item (or says "start <N>"), run the **team loop in §3** — manual
   worktree (real `bun install`, NOT a node_modules symlink — §2), implementer agent, your independent
   verify, adversarial reviewer, fold (targeted `git add`, never `-A`), push, **user merges**, cleanup,
   re-run gates on `main`, update memory.
5. Keep slices thin and vertical. Verify everything yourself. The user trusts terse approvals
   ("merge", "yes", "start N") — earn it by never reporting "done" on something you didn't actually run.
